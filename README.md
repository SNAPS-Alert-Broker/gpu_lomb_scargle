## There are three directories:
* data
* paper
* release

The data directory includes test data (all datasets used in the paper). The paper directory contains the source code used for the experimental evaluation in the paper. And the release code includes both CUDA and OpenACC functionality. The difference between the paper and release code is that many of the GPU performance parameters have been selected for the user so that a reasonable default configuration can be used without extensive knowledge of the details in the paper. However, if the user is interested in all of the bells and whistles included in the paper, then they should use the paper implementation.

Note: We have updated the paper verson of the code base to include multi-GPU functionality. This functionality was not described in the paper.


## Data:
  * Ida 243 in the paper from the ZTF public survey (243_normalized_ztf_filter2.txt)
  * A single synthetic object with 3,555 measurements from the paper (8205_normalized.txt)
  * A batch of synthetic objects using a log-normal distribution from the paper (normalized_alltargs.200724_1_log_normal_obs.dat)
  * Period solutions for the synthetic objects above, given in the column "lcper" (simobj.200724_1.dat)

## Modes: Single Object and Batched 
As described in the paper, the GPU algorithm allows for both a single object to be processed (e.g., a user wants to process a large time series or a large number of frequencies need to be searched). And it also allows for a batch of objects to be processed (e.g., deriving periods for an entire astronomical catalog, or near real-time period finding for ZTF or LSST during nighttime observing). 

## Modes: Standard L-S and Generalized Periodogram (Photometric Error/Floating Mean)
We include two versions. The Standard L-S algorithm that is found in SciPy which does not include photometric errors on the magnitudes is described in great detail throughout the paper. We also include the standard configuration from AstroPy which floats the mean and includes errors photometric errors. 

The dataset file for the standard L-S algorithm should be in the format: object id, time, mag. 

The dataset file for the generalized algorithm should be in the format: object id, time, mag, dmag. 

## Makefile
A makefile has been included for each implementation. Make sure to update the compute capability flag to ensure you compile for the correct architecture. To find out which compute capability your GPU has, please refer to the compute capability table on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA.

## Running the program using the paper implementation (Standard L-S):
After compiling the computer program, you must enter the following command line arguments:
\<dataset file name\> \<minimum frequency\> \<maximum frequency\> \<number of frequencies to search\> \<mode\>
  
The paper implementation has the following modes:
* 1- GPU to process a batch of objects
* 2- GPU to process a single object
* 4- CPU to process a batch of objects
* 5- CPU to process a single object

Example for the batch mode:
$ ./main ../data/normalized_alltargs.200724_1_log_normal_obs.dat 1.005 150.796 1000000 1

## Running the program using the paper implementation (AstroPy Default with Error and Floating Mean):
The default implementation in AstroPy uses the generalized periodogram which floats the mean and includes photmetric errors. To run this version of the code use the same command line input parameters but use a dataset file that includes photometric errors. Make sure to compile using the "ERROR=1" flag.

Example for the batch mode:
$ ./main ../data/normalized_alltargs.200724_1_log_normal_obs_with_error.dat 1.00531 150.796 1000000 1

## Running the program using the release implementation (CUDA GPU):

After compiling the computer program, you must use the flags:
-f <path to data> -min <min frequency> -max < max frequency> -fq <Num frequencies to test> -m <Compute Mode (1-4)>

Note: For a full list of flags use ./main --help

Example using floats and errors on batch of objects:

 ./main -f ../data/normalized_alltargs.200724_1_log_normal_obs_with_error.dat -min 1.005 -max 150.796 -fq 10000 -m 1

Load CUDA runtime (initialization overhead)

Dataset file: ../data/normalized_alltargs.200724_1_log_normal_obs_with_error.dat
Minimum Frequency: 1.005000
Maximum Frequency: 150.796000
Number of frequencies to test: 10000

Running with data type of float for better performance at cost of accuracy.
Set argument 5 to 1 to increase accuracy at cost of performance

Printing is turned off. To print the period of every object to screen, set argument 6 to 1.
